Founder Sam Hupert's ~7% stake is a powerful alignment signal: he has never sold a share, and at ~A$700M, his interests are completely aligned with shareholders. Institutional holders are a mix of passive index (Vanguard, BlackRock, growing with ASX 200 weight increases) and quality-growth active managers (Hyperion, who have been long-term holders through multiple cycles). <strong>Short interest is material at ~4-5% of free float</strong>, driven almost entirely by valuation shorts: funds betting that 163x P/E must eventually compress. These shorts have been persistently wrong; PME has been one of the most costly short positions on the ASX over the past 3 years. The absence of institutional selling despite a 51% drawdown from peak suggests holders have conviction in the long-term thesis, not just momentum. <strong>Key insight:</strong> when quality holders are not selling into a drawdown, and shorts are elevated but not increasing, the register is telling you the smart money believes the thesis is intact even if the multiple is compressing.",

The low score for T3 (Competitive Disruption) reflects the absence of any credible competitive threat in the near term.
