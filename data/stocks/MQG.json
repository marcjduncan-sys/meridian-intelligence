The evidence is <strong>asymmetrically constructive</strong>: the structural tailwinds are verifiable and long-duration, while the headwinds are event-driven and potentially resolvable.",

The ASIC proceedings are a governance cloud but are unlikely to alter the fundamental narrative. The narrative is most vulnerable to a severe downturn in infrastructure fundraising or a material adverse finding from ASIC that constrains capital deployment."
