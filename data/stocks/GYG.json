As escrow periods expire through 2025-26, the market faces significant potential selling pressure. TDM, as a growth PE fund, will eventually need to exit its position; even orderly selling of an 18% stake in a ~A$3B company would take months and create persistent supply. <strong>Short interest is elevated at ~6-7% of free float</strong>, among the highest for recent ASX IPOs. Short sellers are betting on the combination of: escrow release selling, deteriorating same-store sales, US losses, and the stock trading below IPO price (A$22 vs current ~A$20). The register is thin on long-only institutional holders who chose GYG on fundamentals rather than IPO allocation. <strong>Key risk:</strong> the escrow release schedule creates predictable selling catalysts that the market will front-run, likely capping any near-term re-rating.",

The high score for T3 (Growth Maturation) is driven by observable data: same-store sales at 3.7% vs 7.6% forecast, stock below IPO price, P/E at 166x for a QSR business. The low score for T2 (US Expansion Succeeds) reflects both the unit economics (A$2.6M loss per store) and the academic evidence on international QSR expansion failure rates. We note that 5 stores is a very small sample; it is possible (though not supported by current evidence) that unit economics will improve with scale. The Downside skew rating reflects our assessment that the most probable outcome is valuation correction, not business failure."
