T1 (Structural Compounder) remains viable but weakened &mdash; the franchise indicators are defensible but headline numbers were poor. T3 gained evidence from albumin -27%, KCENTRA -20%, and Seqirus -2%. T4 elevated by the CEO departure and portfolio clean-up. These scores will be revised materially based on 2H FY26 results and permanent CEO appointment."
