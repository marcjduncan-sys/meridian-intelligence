FY25 record shipments of 198.4 Mt at an industry-leading C1 cost of US$18.17/wmt (hematite). Two operating divisions: Fortescue Metals (iron ore, 56% EBITDA margin) and Fortescue Energy (green hydrogen, green iron, copper). Energy division has scaled back significantly: cancelled Arizona hydrogen and PEM50 projects with US$150M+ in writedowns. Green hydrogen cost of US$4.50-6.00/kg remains uncompetitive versus grey hydrogen at US$1.00-2.00/kg. Continuing energy initiatives include green iron metal technology, TES partnership, and copper exploration (Alta deal in Peru). Founded by Andrew Forrest, who remains Executive Chairman with ~36% shareholding."

The macro evidence is uniformly negative for iron ore: China peak steel, Simandou supply, EAF growth. The operational evidence is uniformly positive for the Metals division. These two forces are in direct tension, and the stock price suggests the market is weighting Metals resilience more heavily than structural decline.",
