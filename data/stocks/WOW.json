Active institutional ownership has been declining: the stock's underperformance (-11.6% over 5 years) has seen active managers reduce positions. No substantial holder notices filed recently suggesting large block movements, but the absence of active buyer accumulation is itself a signal. <strong>Short interest is modest</strong> (~1.5-2% of shares outstanding), indicating bears are not aggressively positioned but no short squeeze catalyst exists either. The register composition means WOW's share price is largely driven by sector rotation and index rebalancing rather than fundamental conviction. Insider buying is minimal; no director purchases at current prices despite management claiming the stock is undervalued.",
