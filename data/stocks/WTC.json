      "description": "Governance concerns priced in; product moat intact; returns to premium growth trajectory",
      "plain_english": "The worst of the governance crisis is behind WiseTech. The new CEO is stabilising the company, the CargoWise platform remains dominant in its niche, and once investor confidence returns, the stock could recover toward its pre-crisis valuation.",
      "what_to_watch": "New CEO's first strategy update and H1 FY26 customer churn metrics. If churn returns to pre-crisis levels (<5%) and new contract wins resume, recovery becomes credible.",
      "upside": "If governance concerns fully resolve and growth re-accelerates, the stock could re-rate back toward $100+, representing significant upside.",

      "description": "Solid software compounder but de-rated to sector average on governance discount",
      "plain_english": "WiseTech is still a good software business with strong recurring revenue, but investors are no longer willing to pay a premium valuation because of lingering governance concerns. The stock trades at fair value for a mid-growth software company.",
      "what_to_watch": "FY26 ARR growth rate and valuation multiple vs ASX tech peers. If the governance discount narrows and growth holds at 15%+, this narrative holds.",
      "upside": "Stable execution could gradually close the governance discount over 12-18 months.",
      "risk_plain": "If growth slows further or new governance issues surface, even the base case valuation may be too generous.",

      "plain_english": "The governance crisis is not over. More revelations could emerge, key customers might leave because of reputational concerns, and the company's heavy dependence on its founder creates ongoing risk. The stock could fall further.",
      "what_to_watch": "Board investigation outcomes, any new media reports, and mid-market customer retention data. If churn exceeds 8% or new governance issues emerge, this narrative strengthens.",
      "upside": null,
      "risk_plain": "If the governance situation worsens or major customers defect, the stock could test new lows below $60.",

      "what_to_watch": "Competitive product launches from FourKites, project44, or new AI-native logistics platforms. Also monitor key engineering talent retention.",
      "upside": null,
      "risk_plain": "While the CargoWise moat is deep, the company's reliance on one person for technical vision is a genuine structural vulnerability.",
