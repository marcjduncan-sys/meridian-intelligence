  "big_picture": "Xero Limited (ASX: XRO) is a New Zealand-founded, ASX-listed cloud accounting platform serving 4.6 million subscribers globally. The stock has become ground zero for the AI disruption repricing of SaaS &mdash; down 60% from its A$194 high to A$78.50, with the ASX tech sector collapsing 9.4% in a single session triggered by AI capability demonstrations (Anthropic Claude specifically cited as catalyst). Analyst consensus remains unanimously Buy with an average target of A$191, representing 143% upside. Either the market is right and AI will structurally impair cloud accounting, or this is the widest dislocation between price and fundamentals in Xero's listed history.",
