The merger (ACCC approved November 2024) issued 9.9 billion new shares at an implied CW valuation of ~A$8.8B. The combined entity operates ~880+ stores under Chemist Warehouse, My Chemist, Amcal, and Discount Drug Stores brands across Australia, with international operations in New Zealand, Ireland, China, and Dubai. Wagner generics business achieved 12% market share within 6 months of launch. Key strategic assets: vertically integrated wholesale-to-retail model, 35-40% wholesale market share, and the CW brand's dominant consumer pricing position."

The bull case treats SIG as a platform business deserving a premium multiple.
