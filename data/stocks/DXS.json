      "description": "Australian office market recovery drives occupancy, rents, and asset revaluations higher",
      "plain_english": "The worst of the Australian office downturn is over. CBD net absorption is turning positive, vacancy rates are stabilising, and Dexus's premium office portfolio in Sydney and Melbourne is well-positioned to capture the recovery. If cap rates compress and rents grow, NTA per unit will recover and close the gap with the current share price.",
      "what_to_watch": "H1 FY26 results (18 February 2026): office occupancy, like-for-like income growth, and cap rate movements. Positive net absorption across CBDs would confirm the recovery thesis.",
      "upside": "If office cap rates compress 25-50bps and rents grow 3-5%, Dexus NTA could recover meaningfully, driving a share price re-rating.",
      "risk_plain": "If return-to-office trends stall or reverse, and sublease supply increases, the office recovery could take much longer than expected.",

      "description": "Steady-state REIT: stable distributions, gradual portfolio repositioning toward industrial and alternatives",
      "plain_english": "Dexus continues its strategic pivot from pure office toward a diversified real assets platform. Industrial development delivers strong returns, funds management fees grow steadily, and distributions remain well-covered. The stock trades at a discount to NTA but reflects the market's fair assessment of the office headwinds.",
      "what_to_watch": "FY26 distribution guidance and AFFO per security. If AFFO holds above 45 cents and distributions are maintained, the base case holds.",
      "upside": "Funds management platform growth to $50B+ AUM could drive fee income and re-rating as a fund manager, not just a REIT.",

      "label": "Risk/Downside",
      "description": "Structural office decline: hybrid work permanently reduces CBD office demand; asset values fall further",
      "plain_english": "The shift to hybrid work is permanent and accelerating. Companies continue to reduce their office footprint, sublease space floods the market, and CBD vacancy rates stay elevated. Dexus's office-heavy portfolio suffers ongoing valuation writedowns, and the NTA discount to share price persists or widens.",
      "what_to_watch": "CBD vacancy rates (PCA data), tenant lease expiry profiles, and any major tenant downsizing announcements. Rising sublease availability is the clearest negative signal.",
      "upside": null,

      "label": "Disruption",
      "description": "Higher-for-longer interest rates compress REIT valuations; rising cost of debt erodes earnings",
      "plain_english": "If interest rates stay higher for longer than the market expects, REIT valuations face a double hit: higher discount rates compress asset values, and higher debt costs eat into distributable earnings. Dexus, with significant debt facilities, is exposed to refinancing risk at higher rates.",
      "what_to_watch": "RBA cash rate trajectory and bond yields. If the 10-year government bond yield rises above 5%, REIT valuations face further pressure.",
      "upside": null,
